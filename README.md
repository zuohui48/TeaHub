**Motivation** 

Many students regret not studying hard enough after receiving their results at the end of the same. However, they lack the discipline to stay focused during the semester and often find themselves unable to stay focused or procrastinate their work. If only there exists an app where students are able gain a sense of achievement from focusing and completing their work. An all in one focus app where students can set a duration to stay focused and not use their phones for that duration and get rewarded with limited edition collectables. 

And when students are productive and are able to finish their work ahead of the planned time, it is counter-intuitive to be penalized for it. It may serve as a deterrent to those who severely lack focus and commitment to getting work done, but it does not reward those who are more focused and productive.

**Aim**

As many students find themselves zoning off 1 hour into lectures and start using their phones, we aim to increase the levels of concentration for students. Students will also gain a sense of achievement from achieving the goals that they set. 

We aim to integrate a rewards system where users can exchange the points they earned through staying focused into tangible rewards. This will further incentivise students to use the app while studying to help them stay focused. 

**User Stories**

1. As a student who is revising for exams, I want to be able to set a timer for myself to stay focused, and reward myself for being focused and productive. If I can complete my tasks more quickly, I will not be penalized. 

2. As a student studying with my friends taking the same module, I want to be able to stay focused together with my friends, setting the same timer for all of us. All of us will be rewarded together if we finish our timers, thus I am motivated to stay focused for as long as my friends are getting work done.
